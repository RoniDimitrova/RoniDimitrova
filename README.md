- 👋 Hi, I’m @RoniDimitrova!
- 👀 I love video games, music and traveling. 
- 🌱 I’m an MA student, currently studying Localization and Tech Communication. After taking the courses in Mobile App Localization and Web Tools and Languages, I really got in to coding so I wish to improve on it. I have experience with HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, PHP and SQL (the last 2 need some more polishing :D)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to Localization and Web Design. I am a greenhorn but a quick learner with a flexible schedule ;)
